"""
Grids define the domains on which PDEs will be solved. In particular, symmetries,
periodicities, and the discretizations are defined by the underlying grid.

We only consider regular, orthogonal grids, which are constructed from orthogonal
coordinate systems with equidistant discretizations along each axis. The dimension of
the space that the grid describes is given by the attribute :attr:`dim`. Cartesian
coordinates can be mapped to grid coordinates and the corresponding discretization cells
using the method :meth:`transform`.
