        Internally, this class uses :class:`matplotlib.animation.FFMpegWriter`.
        Note that the `ffmpeg` program needs to be installed in a system path,
        so that `matplotlib` can find it.


    Warning:
        The movie is only fully written after the :meth:`save` method has been called.
        To aid with this, it is best practice to use a contextmanager:
