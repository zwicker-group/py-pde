.. This files contains replacements that are used throughout the documentation


.. |Arg_boundary_conditions| replace:: 
  Specifies the boundary conditions for the differential operator. The expected
  instance of :class:`~pde.grid.boundaries.axes.Boundaries` can be created from
  various data formats using the class method
  :func:`~pde.grid.boundaries.axes.Boundaries.from_data`.


.. |Arg_tracker_interval| replace::
    Determines how often the tracker interrupts the simulation. Simple numbers
    are interpreted as durations measured in the simulation time variable.
    Alternatively, a string using the format 'hh:mm:ss' can be used to give
    durations in real time. Finally, instances of the classes defined in 
    :mod:`~pde.trackers.intervals` can be given for more control. 
    
    
.. |Args_plot_quantities| replace:: 
  A list of quantities that are shown side by side. If `quantities` is a simple
  list, the panels will be rendered as a single row, while a 2d list allows
  for multiple rows.
  Each panel is defined by a dictionary, where the item with key 'source' is
  mandatory, since it defines what is being shown.
  The value associated with 'source' can be either an integer specifying the
  component that is shown or a function which is evaluated with the full state
  as input. Additional items in the dictionary are 'title' (setting the title
  of the panel), 'scale' (defining the color range shown; these are typically
  two numbers defining the lower and upper bound, but if only one is given the
  range [0, scale] is assumed), and 'cmap' (defining the colormap being used).
