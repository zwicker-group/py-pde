The `py-pde` python package provides methods and classes useful for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) of the form

.. math::
    \partial_t u(\boldsymbol x, t) = \mathcal D[u(\boldsymbol x, t)] 
        + \eta(u, \boldsymbol x, t) \;,

where :math:`\mathcal D` is a (non-linear) operator containing spatial derivatives that
defines the time evolution of a (set of) physical fields :math:`u` with possibly
tensorial character, which depend on spatial coordinates :math:`\boldsymbol x` and time
:math:`t`.
The framework also supports stochastic differential equations in the It√¥
representation, where the noise is represented by :math:`\eta` above.

The main audience for the package are researchers and students who want to
investigate the behavior of a PDE and get an intuitive understanding of the
role of the different terms and the boundary conditions.
To support this, `py-pde` evaluates PDEs using the methods of lines with a
finite-difference approximation of the differential operators.
Consequently, the mathematical operator :math:`\mathcal D` can be naturally
translated to a function evaluating the evolution rate of the PDE.
